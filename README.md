Project: Determining the Season in the Northern Hemisphere

Project Summary:

This project aims to develop a program that identifies the season based on a given date in the Northern Hemisphere. The program takes two inputs: month (string) and day (integer). 
Using predefined date ranges for each season, it determines and outputs the corresponding season.

Technical Specifications:

Input: Month (string) and Day (integer)
Output: Season (string) - Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter
Logic:
Define date ranges for each season:
Spring: March 20 - June 20
Summer: June 21 - September 21
Autumn: September 22 - December 20
Winter: December 21 - March 19
Compare the input date with the pre-defined ranges for each season.
Based on the comparison, determine and output the corresponding season.
